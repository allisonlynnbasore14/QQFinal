A final Quarter Quiz platform for Center High School math students

After observing first hand a need for standardized test preparation in my own high school, I decided to build and deliver a math quiz platform for students in my high school to better prepare them for standardized testing. Having learned the pattern of standardized testing (ACT, SAT), I was able to produce a web platform that students could log onto and practice math questions. It is currently being used in class twice a week.
